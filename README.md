Mocap is c# WPF .net media player to detect motion

# MVVM is used
(Stylet and cliburn.micro are MVVM libraries)
here for MVVM, I used Stylet which is inspired by Caliburn Micro and has less weight. I have another Caliburn Micro Apps, so I did this to check out Stylet. Caliburn micro became nearly  -no support- but it continued later a little bit.

So used MVVM architecture with Stylet here, rather than Caliburn.mirco

# No referencing ViewModel in view.
Here, full MVVM code is used, and did not referenced view model in view directly ensuring view and view model is losely coupled
